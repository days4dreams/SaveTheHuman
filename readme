A WPF Application using XAML and C#.

Can you Save The Human? Drag the ‘i’ indicator to the safety of the
black square before an alien hits.

Made up of a simple XAML grid container, which holds the gameArea canvas, UI controls and C# click and tick event handlers. Four methods StartGame(), AddEnemy(), AnimateEnemy(), and EndTheGame(). 

Canvas contains various UI controls (buttons, progress bar, text block, ellipse)
